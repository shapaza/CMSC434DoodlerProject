This program is a prototype doodling app built for Android systems. Currently, it allows its user to:
  - Draw lines on a white canvas using a brush
  - Change the color and size of the brush
  - Change the opacity of the color selected
  - Erase doodles
  - Clear the entire canvas
  
This was built using Jon Froehlich's video demo on creating a custom view in Android Studio, located on the CMSC434 wikispaces website, and Sue Smith's tutorial series on creating a drawing app for Android systems. They are linked below.
